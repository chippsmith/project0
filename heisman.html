    <p>Derrick Henry won the 2015 heisman trophy at Alabama.  He rushed for a
      bunch of yards and a bunch of touchdowns.  Unlike previous seasons for
      alabama running backs he did not have a backup take 30-40 percent of the carrys.
      He rushed for 40+ rushes several times in the regular season and seemed to
      get better as the game went on.  He led Alabama to a 14-1 record and a
      win in the national championship game against Clemson.
